## Latest News

### 2022-03-20

Version 4.1.8 has been released.

- [#366](https://github.com/NICMx/Jool/issues/366), [#375](https://github.com/NICMx/Jool/issues/375): Fix checksums in Slow Path.  
  This is a fairly critical bug; please upgrade. It affects packets that fulfill the following conditions:
	- IPv4-to-IPv6
	- Not ICMP error
	- Incoming packet's DF was disabled
	- Packet was large, or GRO-aggregated
- Add validation to more verbosely reject IPv6 packets that contain more than one fragment header.
- Add validation to more verbosely reject fragmented (and not reassembled by `nf_defrag_ipv*`) ICMP errors.  
  (Aside from being fairly illegal, these packets cannot be translated because the "ICMPv6 length" of the [ICMP pseudoheader](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Control_Message_Protocol_for_IPv6#Checksum) is unknown.)
- Bugfix: When routing TCP/UDP fragments, the code was including header ports even though nonzero fragment-offset packets lack TCP/UDP headers.  
  This bug probably doesn't affect you, unless your routing is somehow port-based.
