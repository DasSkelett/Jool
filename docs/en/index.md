## Latest News

### 2020-10-07

[Jool 4.1.4](download.html) has been released.

Bugfixes:

1. [#341](https://github.com/NICMx/Jool/issues/341): Deprecate "blacklist4," add replacement "denylist4."
2. [#342](https://github.com/NICMx/Jool/issues/342): Add /32 to the generic denylist again. (And remove secondary addresses, since nobody has actually requested them.)
3. [#343](https://github.com/NICMx/Jool/issues/343): Clarify some documentation. (WIP)

I also largely rewrote the [intro to xlat](https://nicmx.github.io/Jool/en/intro-xlat.html), to reflect the changes from the MAP-T branch. Feedback would be appreciated.

> Remember that `lowest-ipv6-mtu`'s paranoid default might induce unnecessary fragmentation. If you want Jool 4.1 to reach 4.0's performance, please review the [MTU documentation](mtu.html).
