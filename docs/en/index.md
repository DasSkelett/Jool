Hello, everyone.

I'm running out of known issues. The MAP-T code has matured a fair bit, and so I'd like to let loose an alpha version of Jool 4.2.

Early adopters: Please consume and criticize the new documentation pages, and maybe try out the software:

- [Early introduction to MAP-T](intro-xlat.html#map-t)
- [Detailed explanation of MAP-T](map-t.html)
- [Jool MAP-T tutorial](run-mapt.html)
- [The code](https://github.com/NICMx/Jool/tree/mapt)

I'll aim to post a release candidate tar on December 16, and then wait a month and a half for issues.
