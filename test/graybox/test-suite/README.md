# Graybox Test Suite

[Compile Graybox](../README.md), install the version of Jool you want to test, then

	sudo ./run.sh

It takes about 6 minutes.

Please [report](https://github.com/NICMx/Jool/issues) any errors or queued packets you find. Please include your distro, kernel version (`uname -r`) and the tail of `dmesg` (after the "SIIT/NAT64 Jool vX.Y.Z.W module inserted" caption).
